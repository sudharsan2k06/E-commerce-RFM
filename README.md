📊 E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior in an e-commerce business using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
The goal is to segment customers into meaningful groups so that businesses can take data-driven marketing and retention decisions.
This is a real-world Data Analyst project involving data cleaning, feature engineering, segmentation, visualization, and business insights.

🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce companies often struggle to answer questions like:

•	Who are our most valuable customers?

•	Which customers are likely to churn?

•	Which customers should receive promotions?

•	Where does most revenue come from?

RFM analysis provides a structured way to answer these questions using transaction data.

🧠 What is RFM?

RFM stands for:

•	Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase

•	Frequency (F): How often a customer makes purchases

•	Monetary (M): How much money a customer has spent

Using these three metrics, customers are segmented into meaningful groups.

🔍 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

•	Removed missing Customer IDs

•	Removed canceled transactions

•	Handled duplicates

•	Created total purchase value

________________________________________
2️⃣ Feature Engineering (RFM Calculation)

•	Recency: Days since last purchase

•	Frequency: Number of transactions per customer

•	Monetary: Total spending per customer
________________________________________
3️⃣ Customer Segmentation

•	Normalized RFM values

•	Applied KMeans clustering

•	Segmented customers into groups such as:

o	Champions

o	Loyal Customers

o	Potential Loyalists

o	At-Risk Customers

o	Low-Value Customers

________________________________________
4️⃣ Data Visualization & Dashboard

•	Customer segment distribution

•	Revenue contribution by segment

•	Recency vs Frequency plots

•	Monetary value comparison





________________________________________
📈 Key Insights

•	A small percentage of customers contribute the majority of revenue

•	Loyal and Champion customers show high frequency and high monetary value

•	At-risk customers have high past spending but low recent activity

•	Targeted campaigns can significantly improve retention and revenue
